// difference between tailwing and  shadCN is that shadCN uses pre-defined components and utility classes from the shadCN library to build UIs quickly, while Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to create custom designs by composing utility classes directly in their HTML. ShadCN provides a more structured approach with ready-to-use components, whereas Tailwind offers more flexibility for custom styling. in layman terms, shadCN is like using a set of pre-made building blocks to quickly assemble a house, while Tailwind is like having a toolbox full of various tools and materials to build a house exactly the way you want it from scratch.
//  without installing tailwind we cant use shadCN because shadCN components rely on Tailwind's utility classes for styling.
// Laravel is a PHP framework for web application development, while ShadCN is a design system built on top of Tailwind CSS for building user interfaces in React applications. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts; Laravel is for backend development, whereas ShadCN is for frontend UI development.
