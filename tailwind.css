/* difference between css and tailwind is that Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework .it means it provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without leaving your HTML. instead of writing custom CSS, you use predefined classes directly in your HTML to style elements. 

bootstrap is not used because it is a component-based framework that provides pre-designed components and styles, which can limit customization. difference is that Tailwind allows more flexibility and customization by using utility classes directly in HTML. 
difference between framework and library is that a framework provides a structured foundation and dictates the architecture of your application, while a library is a collection of pre-written code that you can call upon to perform specific tasks without enforcing a particular structure. */
