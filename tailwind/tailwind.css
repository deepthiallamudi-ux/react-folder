/* difference between css and tailwind is that Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework .it means it provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without leaving your HTML. instead of writing custom CSS, you use predefined classes directly in your HTML to style elements. 

bootstrap is not used because it is a component-based framework that provides pre-designed components and styles, which can limit customization. difference is that Tailwind allows more flexibility and customization by using utility classes directly in HTML.
